## Hi there✌️

### I'm Zenon Savchenko and I am an active and single-minded Python developer

#### I have good knowledge of Python Core and the most popular frameworks for web development (Django, Flask, DRF, FastAPI). My strongest point is working in a team, the desire to learn, and quick adaptability.

##### Fun fact: Can name all the states in the USA🇺🇸.
